# Memory Game Project

Hi, this is my Memory Game Project. The Design mockup was provided by Udacity,the functionality is made by myself.

##How to play

When you click a card it will  be flipped, when you flip the second card they will be compared, if its a match you got your first point! The game is finished when all matches are found.
The moment you start the game by flipping your first card a timer starts to count up. And the end you get your move count,  your time and your ratingshown. Hint: to get three stars you have to finish it in less than 14 moves ;)

The cards will be shuffled after every new start!

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
